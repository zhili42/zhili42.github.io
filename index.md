<h2 id="short_bio">Short Bio</h2>

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/" target="_blank">Stony Brook University</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~xiaojun/" target="_blank">Xiaojun Bi</a>. My research interest focuses on AI-driven Human-Computer Interaction, where I employ advanced AI techniques like reinforcement learning, generative AI and large language models to enhance user experiences.

Before moving to Stony Brook, I was in the <a href="http://jhzhang.cn/" target="_blank">IoT Group</a> at <a href="http://www.hdu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Hangzhou Dianzi University</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://jhzhang.cn/" target="_blank">Jianhui Zhang</a>. I received my M.E. degree in Computer Science and B.E. degree in Computer Science both at Hangzhou Dianzi University in 2017 and 2014 respectively.
