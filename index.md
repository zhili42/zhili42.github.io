<h2 id="short_bio">Short Bio</h2>

I am a research scientist at Google, Mountain View. My research interest focuses on AI-driven Human-Computer Interaction, where I employ advanced AI techniques like reinforcement learning, generative AI and large language models to enhance user input experiences.

Before joining Google, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/" target="_blank">Stony Brook University</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~xiaojun/" target="_blank">Xiaojun Bi</a>. I received the M.E. degree and B.E. degree both in Computer Science from Hangzhou Dianzi University.
